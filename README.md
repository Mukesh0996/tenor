# Tenor Clone App - ReactJS


ReactJS app built by using [Tenor](https://tenor.com/en-GB/) and by using [Tenor APIs](https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation#quickstart)

## Available Components

[`Carousel`](https://github.com/Mukesh0996/tenor/tree/main/src/Components/Carousel) - Used this wrapping component to implement carousel effect for the Trending Gifs.

`[FeaturedGifs](https://github.com/Mukesh0996/tenor/tree/main/src/Components/FeaturedGifs)` - Utilised this component to display the top 20 featured Gifs. Implemented scrolling in this component when the scroll reaches the end of the page. New HTTP request is sent to the Tenor server to fetch additional featured gifs. Each HTTP request will fetch 20 gifs which will be shown in the UI. Implmented this functionality learning and using `IntersectionObserver API` in the component. 

`[Header](https://github.com/Mukesh0996/tenor/tree/main/src/Components/Header)` - Component represents the header section of this application.

`[Gif](https://github.com/Mukesh0996/tenor/tree/main/src/Components/Gif/)` - Used to render Gifs' in the entire application. Used this component across multiple components in the app. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
